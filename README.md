  ### How I test the signin middleware
      I simply tested by first adding a user to the database after that
      I test to sign in to that account with correct information
      and I test it with wrong password and it gives me 500 error with message 'wrong password'
      and I test it with wrong username and it gives me 500 error with message 'this account doesnt exist'
